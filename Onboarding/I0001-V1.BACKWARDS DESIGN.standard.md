## !success-criteria

- Backwards design means we start by asking “What should the student be able to do at the end of the course/unit/lesson?” In other words, ”What are the student outcomes?”
- Industry-aligned
  - Definition: learning experiences resemble and prepare students for the real world… prepares them for real problems. Asks them to learn using methods that industry professionals use on the job.
  - How backwards design results in industry-alignment: By regularly asking “What are the skills and behaviors required to get and keep a job?”, we ensure that our standards are regularly updated and align with industry demand.
- Outcomes-Driven
  - Definition: all parts of the curriculum align towards helping students meet the desired outcomes. The curriculum is the means, the outcomes are the end.
  - How backwards design results in an “outcomes-driven” curriculum - By planning what the student will do first, then designing activities/instructional content second, we ensure that all curriculum and instruction builds towards the desired student outcomes.

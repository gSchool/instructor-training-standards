- Measurable - The objective is demonstrable. It starts with a measurable verb and the instructor can determine whether or not the student mastered the objective by reviewing the studentâ€™s work.
- Aligned - Objectives lead to mastery of the standard.
- Scaffolded - Objectives are presented in a logical order, gradually increasing difficulty/complexity.
- Student Centered - Describes what the student will do.

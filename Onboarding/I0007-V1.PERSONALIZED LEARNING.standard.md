## !success-criteria

- How:
  - Using frequent checks for understanding and lots of assessments, we gather data (evidence of learning) about student learning so we can provide students with personalized, just-in-time interventions.
  - The data reveals what the students can and cannot do, highlighting the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD).
  - From fixed grouping to dynamic groupings - group students by mastery of skills/behaviors rather than ‘tracking’ them
- Why:
  - Everyone is different and learns at a different pace (depending on the standard/topic). We don’t all need the same intervention at the same time.
- Zone of Proximal Development:
  - What it is: What the student is capable of learning with some guidance or support.
  - Why keep students here?: The ZPD is the most fruitful place to spend your time and energy as a learner.

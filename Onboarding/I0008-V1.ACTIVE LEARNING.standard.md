## !success-criteria

- Passive Learning- Learning only by watching and listening. The student experience becomes: “I understand the material, but I can’t solve the problems” (From Five Easy Lessons by Randall D. Knight). Passive learning settles for comprehension and tends to result in “illusions of competency”.
- Active Learning -  Learning by doing. Active learners strive for mastery, not just comprehension, by applying their knowledge and skills as they learn.
- Mastery - Fluent, consistent performance of a skill/behavior at the intended level of rigor. Fluent meaning that they rely on ‘muscle memory’.
- How does Active Learning result in mastery?
  - Practice! Active learning requires that you apply knowledge/skills over and over.
  - Shorter feedback loops - more feedback from peers, instructors
  - Avoiding “illusions of competency” - when asked to demonstrate a skill, you find out if you can really do it or not - helps students see their real ZPD.

## !success-criteria

- How
  - Two shifts from ‘Teaching’ to ‘Learning Facilitation’:
  - From explainer to intervener - Interveners let students drive their own learning and help them get unstuck. Interveners strive to use the least invasive intervention when helping students, maximizing Ratio at all times, and striving to keep students in their Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD).
  - From focusing on content to focusing on skills and behaviors - modeling how to think and act like an autodidact are important parts of learning facilitation.
- Why
  - Improved Ratio (student thinking / teacher thinking), harnessing student energy. “Whoever does the work does the learning.”
  - Build/Reinforce autodidactic behaviors in students, arguably the most important thing they can learn.
